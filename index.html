                      I heard from my friends that the front-end competition was going to happen at our college.
                      As I was little known to front-end I decided to participate. The first day a workshop about
                      front-end session which was very fruitful. That workshop made me understand front-end more
                      clearly
                      and I become confident to participate in the competition for the next day. I presented my
                      front-end
                      as a layout of "ChiyaPasal" - where ideas of youths meet. And to my surprise, I was announced
                      second
                      and selected for the next round. I prepared myself for the next level but somewhere I was anxious
                      about
                      what I'm going to do in live Hackathon. I was in the condition to quit the competition but the
                      organizing
                      committee assure me that it's not that tough as I thought, When the final arrived I went to live
                      hackathon
                      with the outline of the website on my head. But the presence of mentors made me more confidence
                      and
                      I gave my best. I presented and all I could do was wait for the result. The next day the finals
                      were
                      held and I was announced as the winner. My hard work paid off. Code for Change made me close to
                      Youth in Social Change. As per their promise I was offered an internship. Code for Change was a
                      life-changing event for me. I would like to present my gratitude form the bottom of my heart to
                      Youth in Social Change for this opportunity. I was in need of direction and YISC guide me through
                      this.

                      I love to speak this is the one thing that I could die for.
                      Youth in Social Change provided the platform to me where I can
                      share my learning to others through speaking. This took place
                      when Youth in Social Change conducted a workshop for nurses.
                      It was a great experience working with YISC. And looking forward
                      to working with YISC in further days more.

                      “A life dedicated to serving others is the life we should all aspire to live.”
                      As a member of YISC, I work towards serving the society and making an impact on the society.
                      I believe wisdom comes from experience and the wisdom that one gets from service is truly wisdom
                      worth having.
                      I have studied in Trinity International College and have participated in various social events.
                      I have been able to feel the joy of serving others. Here in YISC, I find it easier to take steps
                      towards making a better society with an amazing team. I have been fortunate to be a part of this
                      movement.

                      The phrase "Male and female are the two wheels of a cart" is always spelled
                       out in the class and the mass but never felt the situation by me in my existing 
                       society. Still, I myself felt contrite to say that there's is the house where a woman 
                       i.e. a mother had to give birth to a large number of the mother (i.e. the daughter) 
                       throughout her reproductive lifespan to have a boy baby in her family even in my hometown
                        Pokhara. The present context where we had heard "a grand daughter of age 7 years raped by 
                        her grand father", "a girl dying because of Chaupadi Pratha" , "Daughter in law being victimised
                         from mother in law who is also a women" etc. are so gut-wrenching which are the impetus for making
                          me to be the part of Youth In Social Change. After being a part of Youth In Social Change, I have
                           been able to explore me and also fulfill my dream for change in society in different way like ; 
                           Recently, I have been able to conduct a "Self Defense Training" programme for the students of 
                           Maharajgunj Nursing Campus and Ayurveda Campus with the objective of empowerment of women by
                            increase of confidence, self-reliance and reduced fear of violence with the development of new skills.
                             Youth In Social Change is a great platform for those who wants to bring a change in society through youth 
                             (male and female) empowerment , reduced the existing voilence to women and child, utilize the leisure time
                              of youth in science and technology , arts, education, environment, etc to make their times fruitful and work 
                              in unity for nation development. Finally, I wanna adjure to every youth to rise together to bring change in society 
                              for our own nation development.
